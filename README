CFSR Request, Download, and Pre-Processing Program
--------------------------------------------------

	This program requests and downloads CFSR data, that is then 
	converted to GRIB (version 1) via convert_2_grib scripts. The 
	version 1 GRIB files are then ready to be pre-processed by 
	WPS. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of babysitting this 
	program while it runs, unlike downloading ERA-Interim data. 
	Currently, this is the most automated and quickest retrieval 
	version that I have developed to obtain CFSR data.

	It is strongly recommended to use version 1 GRIB files as 
	version 2 files are pre-processed significantly slower by WPS, 
	and WPS version 3.2 is not set up to work with version 2 GRIB.

	NCEP CFSR archived data has some corruption of data, so it is 
	strongly recommended the user checks for corruption before 
	pre-processing the data in WPS. This may simply be done by 
	checking the log files of data being output from 
	convert_2_grib scripts - corrupt data will not be converted, 
	and will result in an error being output.

	It is always recommended to check that all files were 
	successfully downloaded as the hardware systems tend to have 
	hiccups, resulting in failed downloads. It is good practice 
	to check both the number of files (ls -1 *.grb2 | wc -l) and 
	file sizes (for each f in *.grb2; do du -h $f ;done).

	There is a maximum of 10 requests/time. To view and delete 
	requests, log in to the archive at 
	rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.0 and navigate to your Dashboard. 
	After 10 requests have been submitted, the user will need to 
	download the data. Further requests may then be made. The 
	batchreq.sh and batchdl.sh scripts allow data to be requested 
	and downloaded in sets not exceeding 10/time by adjusting the 
	"FIRSTPASS" flag.

How to use this program:

        1.  batchreq.sh - This program requests the data that will be 
			  downloaded. Before running this script, add 
			  your UCAR password to the environment flag 
			  "pswd", and edit the script to fit your 
			  data and workspace.
	2.  After batchreq.sh is complete, the user will need to 
	    navigate to their Dashboard and obtain the perl download 
	    scripts for each request. Save the individual perl 
	    scripts as "get_file.pl" to the respective variable 
	    directories. The environment variable "pswd" should be 
	    set to your UCAR password.
	3.  batchdl.sh - This program downloads the data. Before 
			 running this script, add your UCAR password 
			 to the "RDAPSWD" variable, and edit the 
			 script to fit your data and workspace.
	4.  After the downloads have completed, navigate to your 
	    Dashboad and delete the data. The user will then be ready 
	    to repeat steps (1) - (4) to obtain additional data.
	5.  convert_2_grib.sh - This program converts the version 2 
				GRIB data to version 1 GRIB. Before 
				running this script, edit the script 
				to fit your data and workspace.
